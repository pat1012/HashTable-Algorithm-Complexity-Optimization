# HashTable-Algorithm-Complexity-Optimization

I introduced the node struct to save the identifierâ€™s value, line number and the scope number in which it is declared.  
I implemented the SymbolTableImpl with a HashTable of list<Node>.       
I chose this type of container because it's cheap in terms of time complexity.

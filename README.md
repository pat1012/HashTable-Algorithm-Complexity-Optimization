# HashTable-Algorithm-Complexity-Optimization

I introduced the struct node to save the identifierâ€™s value, line number and the scope number in which it is declared.
I implemented the SymbolTableImpl with a HashTable of list<Node>.
I choose this type of container because it is very cheap in terms of time complexity.
